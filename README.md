#Knightpass-app

Actual project folder, currently uploaded is the single player version of the game, the BTLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) version
has a bug that causes it only to function correctly when the app is in the foreground on the phone.  The version will
be updated to the more interesting multi player version when the cordova framework adds a peer-to-peer module to allow that
functionality from iOS 8.  Who knows, if I have time to write it I might make one myself.  

Upcoming changes: Needs new graphics.  Project for class was focused on functionality.  Not exactly the best looking thing ever.
Animations, sprite-sheets, and backgrounds.  

Project Development time: This project was developed in 10 weeks, Unfortunately I didn't have un-restricted development time,
work and other classes also took up time.
